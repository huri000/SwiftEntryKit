## Overview

SwiftEntryKit is a simple yet versatile content presenter written in Swift.

### Features

Banners or pop-ups are called *Entries*.

- Entries are displayed inside a separate UIWindow (of type EKWindow), so users are able to navigate the app freely while entries are being displayed in a non intrusive manner.
- The kit offers beautiful [presets](#presets) that can be themed with your own colors and fonts.
- **Customization**: Entries are highly customizable
  - [x] Can be [positioned](#display-position) either at the top, center, or the bottom of the screen.
  - [x] Can be displayed within or outside the screen safe area.
  - [x] Can be stylized: have a [border](#border), [drop-shadow](#shadow) and [round corners](#round-corners).
  - [x] Their content and the surrounding background can be blurred, dimmed, colored or have a gradient [style](#background-style).
  - [x] Transition [animations](#animations) are customizable - entrance, exit and pop (by another entry).
  - [x] The [user interaction](#user-interaction) with the entry or the screen can be intercepted.
  - [x] Entries can be enqueued or override previous entries using the [precedence](#precedence) attribute.
  - [x] Each entry has a [display priority](#display-priority) attribute. That means that it can be dismissed only by other entry with an equal or higher priority. 
  - [x] Presets support accessibility.
  - [x] Entries have an optional rubber banding effect while panning.
  - [x] Entries can be optionally dismissed using a simple [swipe gesture](#swiping-and-rubber-banding).
  - [x] Entries can be optionally injected with [lifecycle events](#lifecycle-events): *will* and *did* appear/disappear.
  - [x] The [status bar style](#status-bar) is settable for the display duration of the entry.
  - [x] Supports [navigation controllers](#presets) & [custom views](#custom-view-usage-example) as well!

## Example Project

The example project contains various presets and examples you can use and modify as your like.

### Example Project Installation 

You can either use the terminal or git client such as Source Tree.
*The zip file doesn't contain a necessary dependency ([QuickLayout](https://github.com/huri000/QuickLayout)).*

```

After specifying `"SwiftEntryKit"` as a dependency of the target in which you want to use it, run `accio install`.

## Usage

### Quick Usage

No setup is needed! Each time you wish to display an entry, just create your view and initialize an EKAttributes struct.
See also the [preset usage example](#presets-usage-example), and the example project.
likewise:
```Swift
// Customized view
let customView = SomeCustomView()
/*
Do some customization on customView
*/

// Attributes struct that describes the display, style, user interaction and animations of customView.
var attributes = EKAttributes()
/*
Adjust preferable attributes
*/
```
And then, just call:
```Swift
SwiftEntryKit.display(entry: customView, using: attributes)
```
The kit will replace the application main window with the EKWindow instance and display the entry.

### Entry Attributes

*EKAttributes* is the entry's descriptor. Each time an entry is displayed, an EKAttributes struct is necessary to describe the entry's presentation, position inside the screen, the display duration, its frame constraints (if needed), its styling (corners, border and shadow), the user interaction events, the animations (in / out) and more.

Create a mutable EKAttributes structure likewise:
```Swift
var attributes = EKAttributes()
```

Below are the properties that can be modified in the *EKAttributes*:

#### Entry Name
Entries can have names.
When an EKAttributes struct is instantiated, it is nameless, meaning, the `name` property is `nil`. 
It is recommended to set a meaningful name for an entry.

```Swift 
attributes.name = "Top Note"
```

Entries with names can be specifically referred to later, for example, you can inquire whether a **specific** entry is currently displayed:
```Swift
if SwiftEntryKit.isCurrentlyDisplaying(entryNamed: "Top Note") {
    /* Do your things */
}
```

#### Window Level
Entries can be displayed above the application main window, above the status bar, above the alerts window or even have a custom level (UIWindowLevel).

For example, set the window level to *normal*, likewise:
```Swift 
attributes.windowLevel = .normal
```
This causes the entry to appear above the application key window and below the status bar.

The default value of `windowLevel` is `.statusBar`.

#### Display Position
The entry can be displayed either at the *top*, *center*, or the *bottom* of the screen.

For example, set the display position to *bottom*, likewise:
```Swift 
attributes.position = .bottom
```

The default value of `position` is `.top`.

#### Precedence
The precedence attribute of an entry describes the manner in which entries are pushed in. It offers 2 approaches for managing the presentation priority of multiple simultaneous entries.

##### Override
If the [display priority](#display-priority) is equal or higher than the currently displayed entry, override it.

Example for setting `.override` precedence with `.max` display priority while ignoring entries that are already enqueued (leaving them to display after the new entry is dismissed).

```Swift 
attributes.precedence = .override(priority: .max, dropEnqueuedEntries: false)
```

You can optionally flush the entries that are inside the queue.

In case  `dropEnqueuedEntries` is `false`, enqueued entries remain in the queue. The first enqueued entry will show right after the new entry pops out. 
In case  `dropEnqueuedEntries` is `true`, the entry-queue is flushed as the new entry is being displayed.

##### Enqueue
If the queue is empty, display the entry immediately, otherwise, insert the entry into the queue until its turn to show arrives.

Example for setting `.enqueue` precedence with `.normal` display priority: 

```Swift 
attributes.precedence = .enqueue(priority: .normal)
```

###### Heuristics

There are 2 possible heuristics for entries prioritization in the queue:

- Display Priority Queue: The entries are sorted by their [display priority](#display-priority), then by chronological order.
- Chronological Queue: The entries are sorted only by their chronological order (standard queue).

Select the heuristic that suits you best by doing the following, only once, before using `SwiftEntryKit` to display entries.

```Swift 
EKAttributes.Precedence.QueueingHeuristic.value = .priority
```

Or:

```Swift 
EKAttributes.Precedence.QueueingHeuristic.value = .chronological
```

The default value of `EKAttributes.Precedence.QueueingHeuristic.value` is `.priority`.

The default value of precedence is `.override(priority: .normal, dropEnqueuedEntries: false)`.

##### Display Priority 
The display priority of the entry determines whether it dismisses other entries or is dismissed by them. 
An entry can be dismissed only by an entry with an equal or a higher display priority.

```Swift
let highPriorityAttributes = EKAttributes()
highPriorityAttributes.precedence.priority = .high

let normalPriorityAttributes = EKAttributes()
normalPriorityAttributes.precedence.priority = .normal

// Display high priority entry
SwiftEntryKit.display(entry: view1, using: highPriorityAttributes)

// Display normal priority entry (ignored!)
SwiftEntryKit.display(entry: view2, using: normalPriorityAttributes)
```

*view2* won't be displayed!

#### Display Duration
The display duration of the entry (Counted from the moment the entry has finished its entrance animation and until the exit animation begins).

Display for 4 seconds:
```Swift
attributes.displayDuration = 4
```

Display for an infinite duration
```Swift
attributes.displayDuration = .infinity
```

The default value of `displayDuration` is `2`.

#### Position Constraints 
Constraints that tie the entry tightly to the screen context, for example: Height, Width, Max Width, Max Height, Additional Vertical Offset & Safe Area related info.

- Entries that support Auto Layout - Their height is inferred from the constraints that applied to them.
- Entries that don't support Auto Layout - Their exact size must be explicitly set using `positionConstraints`'s `size` property.

For example:

Ratio edge - signifies that the ratio of the width edge has a ratio of 0.9 of the screen's width.
```Swift
let widthConstraint = EKAttributes.PositionConstraints.Edge.ratio(value: 0.9)
```

Intrinsic edge - signifies that the wanted height value is the content height - Decided by the entries vertical constraints
```Swift
let heightConstraint = EKAttributes.PositionConstraints.Edge.intrinsic
```

Create the entry size constraints likewise:
```Swift
attributes.positionConstraints.size = .init(width: widthConstraint, height: heightConstraint)
```
You can also set *attributes.positionConstraints.maxSize* in order to make sure the entry does not exceeds predefined limitations. This is useful on [device orientation change](#how-to-deal-with-orientation-change).

Safe Area - can be used to override the safe area or to color it (More examples are in the example project)
That snippet implies that the safe area insets should be kept and not be a part of the entry.
```Swift
attributes.positionConstraints.safeArea = .empty(fillSafeArea: false)
```

Vertical Offset - an additional offset that can be applied to the entry (Other than the safe area).
```Swift
attributes.positionConstraints.verticalOffset = 10
```

Autorotation - whether the entry autorotates along with the orientation of the device. Defaults to `true`.
```Swift
attributes.positionConstraints.rotation.isEnabled = false
```

Keyboard Releation - used to bind an entry to the keyboard once the keyboard is displayed.

```Swift
let offset = EKAttributes.PositionConstraints.KeyboardRelation.Offset(bottom: 10, screenEdgeResistance: 20)
let keyboardRelation = EKAttributes.PositionConstraints.KeyboardRelation.bind(offset: offset)
attributes.positionConstraints.keyboardRelation = keyboardRelation
```
In the example above the entry's bottom is tuned to have a 10pts offset from the top of the keyboard (while it shows)
Because the entry's frame might exceed the screen bounds, the user might not see all the entry - we wouldn't want that. Therefore, an additional associated value has been added - `screenEdgeResistance` with value of 20pts. That is, to make sure that the entry remains within the bounds of the screen, and always visible to the user.
The extreme situation might occur as the device orientation is landscape and the keyboard shows up (See example project form presets for more information).

#### User Interaction
The entry and the screen can be interacted by the user. User interaction be can intercepted in various ways:

An interaction (Any touch whatsoever) with the entry delays its exit by 3s:
```Swift
attributes.entryInteraction = .delayExit(by: 3)
```

A tap on the entry / screen dismisses it immediately:
```Swift
attributes.entryInteraction = .dismiss
attributes.screenInteraction = .dismiss
```

A tap on the entry is swallowed (ignored):
```Swift
attributes.entryInteraction = .absorbTouches
```

A tap on the screen is forwarded to the lower level window, in most cases the receiver will be the application window.
This is very useful when you want to display an unintrusive content like banners and push notification entries.
```Swift
attributes.screenInteraction = .forward
```

Pass additional actions that are invoked when the user taps the entry:
```Swift
let action = {
    // Do something useful
}
attributes.entryInteraction.customTapActions.append(action)
```

The default value of `screenInteraction` is `.forward`.

The default value of `entryInteraction` is `.dismiss`.

#### Scroll Behavior
Describes the entry behavior when it's being scrolled, that is, dismissal by a swipe gesture and a rubber band effect much similar to a UIScrollView.

Disable the pan and swipe gestures on the entry:
```Swift
attributes.scroll = .disabled
```

Enable swipe and stretch and pullback with jolt effect:
```Swift
attributes.scroll = .enabled(swipeable: true, pullbackAnimation: .jolt)
```

Enable swipe and stretch and pullback with an ease-out effect:
```Swift
attributes.scroll = .enabled(swipeable: true, pullbackAnimation: .easeOut)
```

Enable swipe but disable stretch:
```Swift
attributes.scroll = .edgeCrossingDisabled(swipeable: true)
```

The default value of `scroll` is `.enabled(swipeable: true, pullbackAnimation: .jolt)`.

#### [Haptic Feedback](https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/user-interaction/feedback/)
The device can produce a haptic feedback, thus adding an additional sensory depth to each entry.

The default value of `hapticFeedbackType` is `.none`.

#### Lifecycle Events
Events can be injected to the entry so that they are to be called during its lifecycle.

```Swift
attributes.lifecycleEvents.willAppear = {
    // Executed before the entry animates inside 
}

attributes.lifecycleEvents.didAppear = {
    // Executed after the entry animates inside
}

attributes.lifecycleEvents.willDisappear = {
    // Executed before the entry animates outside
}

attributes.lifecycleEvents.didDisappear = {
    // Executed after the entry animates outside
}
```

#### Display Mode
To allow you to fully support any user interface style, `SwiftEntryKit` introduces two specialized types:
- `EKColor` describes a color under light and dark modes.
- `EKAttributes.BackgroundStyle.BlurStyle` describes a blur effect under light and dark modes. 

The following forces `SwiftEntryKit` to display the entry on dark mode.
```Swift
attributes.displayMode = .dark
```

The possible values are: `.light`, `.dark`, `.inferred`.
The default value is `.inferred`, which means that the entry will be displayed with the current user interface style.

#### Background Style
The entry and the screen can have various background styles, such as blur, color, gradient and even an image.

The following example implies clear background for both the entry and the screen:
```Swift
attributes.entryBackground = .clear
attributes.screenBackground = .clear
```

Colored entry background and dimmed screen background:
```Swift
attributes.entryBackground = .color(color: .standardContent)
attributes.screenBackground = .color(color: EKColor(UIColor(white: 0.5, alpha: 0.5)))
```

Gradient entry background (diagonal vector):
```Swift
let colors: [EKColor] = ...
attributes.entryBackground = .gradient(gradient: .init(colors: colors, startPoint: .zero, endPoint: CGPoint(x: 1, y: 1)))
```

Visual Effect entry background:
```Swift
attributes.entryBackground = .visualEffect(style: .light)
```

The default value of `entryBackground` and `screenBackground` is `.clear`. 

#### Shadow
The shadow that surrounds the entry.

Enable shadow around the entry:
```Swift
attributes.shadow = .active(with: .init(color: .black, opacity: 0.3, radius: 10, offset: .zero))
```

Disable shadow around the entry:
```Swift
attributes.shadow = .none
```

The default value of `shadow` is `.none`. 

#### Round Corners
Round corners around the entry.

Only top left and right corners with radius of 10:
```Swift
attributes.roundCorners = .top(radius: 10)
```

Only bottom left and right corners with radius of 10:
```Swift
attributes.roundCorners = .bottom(radius: 10)
```

All corners with radius of 10:
```Swift
attributes.roundCorners = .all(radius: 10)
```

No round corners:
```Swift
attributes.roundCorners = .none
```

The default value of `roundCorners` is `.none`. 

#### Border
The border around the entry.

Add a black border with thickness of 0.5pts:
```Swift
attributes.border = .value(color: .black, width: 0.5)
```

No border:
```Swift
attributes.border = .none
```

The default value of `border` is `.none`. 

#### Animations
Describes how the entry animates into and out of the screen. 

* Each animation descriptor can have up to 3 types of animations at the same time. Those can be combined to a single complex one!
* Translation animation anchor can be explicitly set but it receives a default value according to position of the entry.

Example for _translation_ from top with spring, _scale_ in and even _fade in_ as a single entrance animation:
```Swift
attributes.entranceAnimation = .init(
                 translate: .init(duration: 0.7, anchorPosition: .top, spring: .init(damping: 1, initialVelocity: 0)), 
                 scale: .init(from: 0.6, to: 1, duration: 0.7), 
                 fade: .init(from: 0.8, to: 1, duration: 0.3))
```

The default value of `entranceAnimation` and `exitAnimation` is `.translation` - The entry translates in or out, respectively, with duration of 0.3 seconds. 

#### Pop Behavior
Describes the entry behavior when it's being popped (dismissed by an entry with equal / higher display-priority.

The entry is being popped animatedly:
```Swift
attributes.popBehavior = .animated(animation: .init(translate: .init(duration: 0.2)))
```

The entry is being overridden (Disappears promptly):
```Swift
attributes.popBehavior = .overridden
```

The default value of `popBehavior` is `.animated(animation: .translation)` - It translates out with duration of 0.3 seconds. 

#### Status Bar
The status bar appearance can be modified during the display of the entry. 
SwiftEntryKit supports both *View controller-based status bar appearance* and manual setting. 

Setting the status bar style is fairly simple - 

Status bar becomes visible and gets a light style:
```Swift
attributes.statusBar = .light
```

The status bar becomes hidden:
```Swift
attributes.statusBar = .hidden
```

The status bar appearance is inferred from the previous context (won't be changed):
```Swift
attributes.statusBar = .inferred
```

In case there is an already presenting entry with lower/equal display priority, the status bar will change its style. 
When the entry is removed, the status bar gets its initial style back.

The default value of `statusBar` is `.inferred`. 

#### EKAttributes' interface is as follows:

```Swift
public struct EKAttributes

    // Identification
    public var name: String?

    // Display
    public var windowLevel: WindowLevel
    public var position: Position
    public var precedence: Precedence
    public var displayDuration: DisplayDuration
    public var positionConstraints: PositionConstraints

    // User Interaction
    public var screenInteraction: UserInteraction
    public var entryInteraction: UserInteraction
    public var scroll: Scroll
    public var hapticFeedbackType: NotificationHapticFeedback
    public var lifecycleEvents: LifecycleEvents

    // Theme & Style
    public var displayMode = DisplayMode.inferred
    public var entryBackground: BackgroundStyle
    public var screenBackground: BackgroundStyle
    public var shadow: Shadow
    public var roundCorners: RoundCorners
    public var border: Border
    public var statusBar: StatusBar
    
    // Animations
    public var entranceAnimation: Animation
    public var exitAnimation: Animation
    public var popBehavior: PopBehavior
}
```

### Presets Usage Example:

You can use one of the presets that come with SwiftEntryKit, doing these 4 simple steps:

1. Create your *EKAttributes* struct and set your preferable properties.
2. Create *EKNotificationMessage* struct (The Content) and set the content.
3. Create *EKNotificationMessageView* (The View) and inject *EKNotificationMessage* struct to it.
4. Display the entry using *SwiftEntryKit* class method.

#### EKNotificationMessageView preset example:

```Swift
// Generate top floating entry and set some properties
var attributes = EKAttributes.topFloat
attributes.entryBackground = .gradient(gradient: .init(colors: [EKColor(.red), EKColor(.green)], startPoint: .zero, endPoint: CGPoint(x: 1, y: 1)))
attributes.popBehavior = .animated(animation: .init(translate: .init(duration: 0.3), scale: .init(from: 1, to: 0.7, duration: 0.7)))
attributes.shadow = .active(with: .init(color: .black, opacity: 0.5, radius: 10, offset: .zero))
attributes.statusBar = .dark
attributes.scroll = .enabled(swipeable: true, pullbackAnimation: .jolt)
attributes.positionConstraints.maxSize = .init(width: .constant(value: UIScreen.main.minEdge), height: .intrinsic)

let title = EKProperty.LabelContent(text: titleText, style: .init(font: titleFont, color: textColor))
let description = EKProperty.LabelContent(text: descText, style: .init(font: descFont, color: textColor))
let image = EKProperty.ImageContent(image: UIImage(named: imageName)!, size: CGSize(width: 35, height: 35))
let simpleMessage = EKSimpleMessage(image: image, title: title, description: description)
let notificationMessage = EKNotificationMessage(simpleMessage: simpleMessage)

let contentView = EKNotificationMessageView(with: notificationMessage)
SwiftEntryKit.display(entry: contentView, using: attributes)
```

### Custom View Usage Example:

```Swift
// Create a basic toast that appears at the top
var attributes = EKAttributes.topToast

// Set its background to white
attributes.entryBackground = .color(color: .white)

// Animate in and out using default translation
attributes.entranceAnimation = .translation
attributes.exitAnimation = .translation

let customView = UIView()
/*
... Customize the view as you like ...
*/

// Display the view with the configuration
SwiftEntryKit.display(entry: customView, using: attributes)
```

### Displaying a View Controller
As from version 0.4.0, view controllers are supported as well.

```Swift
SwiftEntryKit.display(entry: customViewController, using: attributes)
```

### Alternative Rollback Window
By default, the window held by the application delegate becomes the key again right after SwiftEntryKit has finished displaying the entry.
This behavior can be changed using `rollbackWindow` parameter.

```Swift
SwiftEntryKit.display(entry: view, using: attributes, rollbackWindow: .custom(window: alternativeWindow))
```
After the entry has been dismissed, the given window `alternativeWindow` would become the key instead of the window that is held by the application delegate.

### Dismissing an Entry
You can dismiss the currently displayed entry by simply invoke *dismiss* in the SwiftEntryKit class, likewise:

```Swift
SwiftEntryKit.dismiss()
```
Or:

```Swift
SwiftEntryKit.dismiss(.displayed)
```

This dismisses the entry animatedly using its *exitAnimation* attribute and on completion, the window would be removed as well.

You can dismiss the currently displayed entry and flush the queue as well, likewise:

```Swift
SwiftEntryKit.dismiss(.all)
```

Only flush the queue, leaving any currently displayed entry to its natural lifecycle:

```Swift
SwiftEntryKit.dismiss(.queue)
```

Dismiss a specific entry by name - either currently displayed or enqueued. All the entries with the given name are dismissed.

```Swift
SwiftEntryKit.dismiss(.specific(entryName: "Entry Name"))
```

Dismiss any entry with a lower or equal display priority of `.normal`.

```Swift
SwiftEntryKit.dismiss(.prioritizedLowerOrEqualTo(priority: .normal))
```

#### Using a completion handler

Inject a trailing closure to be executed after the entry dismissal.

```Swift
SwiftEntryKit.dismiss {
    // Executed right after the entry has been dismissed
}
```

### Is Currently Displaying
Inquire whether an entry is currently displayed:
```Swift
if SwiftEntryKit.isCurrentlyDisplaying {
    /* Do your things */
}
```

Inquire whether a **specific** entry is currently displayed using the `name` property inside `EKAttributes`.
```Swift
if SwiftEntryKit.isCurrentlyDisplaying(entryNamed: "Top Note") {
/* Do your things */
}
```

### Queue Contains
Inquire whether the queue of entries is not empty:
```Swift
if SwiftEntryKit.isQueueEmpty {
    /* Do your things */
}
```

Inquire whether the queue of entries contains an entry with name:
```Swift
if SwiftEntryKit.queueContains(entryNamed: "Custom-Name") {
    /* Do your things */
}
```

### Swiping and Rubber Banding
Entries can be panned vertically (This ability can be enabled using the *scroll* attributes). 
Thefore it's only natural that an entry can be dismissed using a swipe-like gesture.

Enable swipe gesture. When the swipe gesture fails (doesn't pass the velocity threshold) ease it back.
```Swift
attributes.scroll = .enabled(swipeable: true, pullbackAnimation: .easeOut)
```

Enable swipe gesture. When the swipe gesture fails throw it back out with a jolt.
```Swift
attributes.scroll = .enabled(swipeable: true, pullbackAnimation: .jolt)
```

The *PullbackAnimation* values (duration, damping & initialSpringVelocity) can be customized as well.

Swipe | Jolt

### Dealing with safe area:
*EKAttributes.PositionConstraints.SafeArea* may be used to override the safe area with the entry's content, or to fill the safe area with a background color (like [Toasts](https://github.com/huri000/assets/blob/master/swift-entrykit/toasts.gif) do), or even leave the safe area empty (Like [Floats](https://github.com/huri000/assets/blob/master/swift-entrykit/floats.gif) do).

SwiftEntryKit supports iOS 11.x.y and is backward compatible to iOS 9.x.y, so the status bar area is treated as same as the safe area in earlier iOS versions.

### Dealing with orientation change:
SwiftEntryKit identifies orientation changes and adjust the entry's layout to those changes.
Therefore, if you wish to limit the entries's width, you are able to do so by giving it a maximum value, likewise:

```Swift
var attributes = EKAttributes.topFloat

// Give the entry the width of the screen minus 20pts from each side, the height is decided by the content's contraint's
attributes.positionConstraints.size = .init(width: .offset(value: 20), height: .intrinsic)

// Give the entry maximum width of the screen minimum edge - thus the entry won't grow much when the device orientation changes from portrait to landscape mode.
let edgeWidth = min(UIScreen.main.bounds.width, UIScreen.main.bounds.height)
attributes.positionConstraints.maxSize = .init(width: .constant(value: edgeWidth), height: .intrinsic)

let customView = UIView()
/*
... Customize the view as you like ...
*/

// Use class method of SwiftEntryKit to display the view using the desired attributes
SwiftEntryKit.display(entry: customView, using: attributes)
```

### Dark Mode in the Example Project

You can tinker with the display mode using a segmented control on presets screen, forcing light and dark modes.
All the presets are dark mode ready, but only some in the example project demonstrate dark mode capabilities.

### Swift and Objective-C Interoperability
SwiftEntryKit's APIs use the Swift language exclusive syntax (enums, associated values, and more). 
Therefore, `SwiftEntryKit` cannot be referenced directly from an Objective-C file (*.m*, *.h* or *.mm*).

Yet, it is pretty easy to integrate SwiftEntryKit into an Objective-C project using a simple *.swift* class that is a sort of adapter between `SwiftEntryKit` and your Objective-C code.

[This project](https://github.com/huri000/ObjcEntryKitExample) demonstrates that using Carthage and CocoaPods.
